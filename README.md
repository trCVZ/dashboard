# Dashboard (*unfinished*)

This project is a reproduction of the dashboard demonstrated in the video by [EdRoh](https://youtu.be/wYpCWwD1oz0).
This project has greatly helped me to become more familiar with React, MUI, and other libraries.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all required packages including:

- @mui/material
- @emotion/react
- @emotion/styled
- @mui/x-data-grid
- @mui/icons-material
- react-router-dom@6
- react-pro-sidebar
- formik
- yup
- @fullcalendar/core
- @fullcalendar/daygrid
- @fullcalendar/timegrid
- @fullcalendar/list
- @nivo/core
- @nivo/pie
- @nivo/line
- @nivo/bar
- @nivo/geo

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server using:


```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser.
